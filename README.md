# VIS - Virtual Intelligence System 

_This is temporary repo_

**I have started this project to make a utility bot to help out with some of my task. But currently it is being used as a webhook trigger for how questions in Group Chat. My friends tend to ask simple questions most of the time without googling them. So I made a this to check the messages for "how" keyword and send back generated LMGTFY link to group.This is a temporary and I will create totally new repo for this.**
